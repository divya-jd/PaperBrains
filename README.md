# ðŸ§¾ PaperBrains â€“ Intelligent Multimodal Document Understanding

PaperBrains is an AI-driven **document intelligence system** that combines the power of **OCR, Vision Transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to read, interpret, and summarize complex business documents such as **invoices, claim forms, and financial reports**.

It transforms unstructured visual data into structured insights â€” automating what traditionally required manual review.

## Project Overview

PaperBrains mimics how humans read documents:

**Sees the document** â€” using Vision Transformers and CLIP to understand layout and visual cues.

**Reads the text** â€” using OCR (Tesseract) to extract text accurately from PDFs or images.

**Thinks and summarizes** â€” using an LLM (like GPT-4 or Claude) to generate structured summaries, key entities, or responses to queries.

This architecture enables multimodal reasoning â€” where both text and visuals contribute to understanding the document holistically.

## Features

> **OCR-based text extraction** via pytesseract

> **Vision-Language embeddings** using CLIP or BLIP

> **LLM-powered contextual understanding** for summaries & Q&A

> **FastAPI backend** for real-time document intelligence API

> **Batch pipeline support** for processing multiple documents

> **Evaluation framework** for extraction accuracy and latency

## Example API Response
{
  "entities": {
    "invoice_number": "INV-2025-0043",
    "client": "TechNova Inc",
    "total": "$5,120"
  },
  "summary": "Invoice INV-2025-0043 for TechNova Inc. Total billed amount: $5,120 due within 30 days.",
  "confidence_score": 0.96
}

## Future Improvements

> Add table structure extraction using LayoutLMv3

> Fine-tune multimodal models for document-specific datasets

> Deploy scalable inference via AWS Lambda + S3

> Integrate human feedback loops for continual learning
